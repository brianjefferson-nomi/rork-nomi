## 🔄 **Alternative: Direct API Keys**

If you prefer not to use RapidAPI, you can get direct API keys:

### **Google Places API**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Places API
4. Create API key
5. Set billing (first $200 free/month)

### **Yelp Fusion API**
1. Go to [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers)
2. Create app
3. Get API key
4. Free tier: 500 calls/day

### **TripAdvisor API**
1. Go to [TripAdvisor Developer Portal](https://developer-tripadvisor.com/)
2. Register as developer
3. Apply for API access
4. Wait for approval

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **RapidAPI Advantages:**
- ✅ Single API key for multiple services
- ✅ Unified dashboard
- ✅ Built-in rate limiting
- ✅ Easy integration

### **Direct API Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Multiple API keys to manage
- ❌ Different rate limits per service
- ❌ Separate billing per service
- ❌ More complex setup

## 🎉 **After Upgrade**

Once you upgrade, your APIs should work immediately. The app will automatically start using external data sources instead of fallbacks.

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ TripAdvisor: Restaurant search working
- ✅ Yelp: Business data available
- ✅ Google Places: Location-based search
- ✅ Local Business Data: Comprehensive business info
- ✅ Foursquare: Still needs OAuth2 setup (separate issue)
